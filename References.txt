Models:
Time-series models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks, or traditional statistical time-series models like ARIMA.
Regression models: Linear regression, polynomial regression, or ensemble methods like Random Forest Regression.
Deep learning models: CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image analysis, combined with recurrent layers for sequential data if needed.
