**Plant-Disease-and-Pesticide-Quantity-Detection** 

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases and optimizing pesticide quantities for tomato plants using the TomatoVillage dataset. The aim is to improve the accuracy of pesticide application by performing a comprehensive analysis of multilabel leaf data.

Project Overview
The model evaluates various leaf observations and provides optimized pesticide quantities based on the following key factors:

Disease Type: Identifies the type of disease affecting the tomato plant.
Severity: Determines the extent of the disease.
Plant Age: Considers the age of the plant to adjust pesticide recommendations.
By addressing these factors, the model helps in applying accurate pesticide quantities, reducing waste, and improving crop health.
